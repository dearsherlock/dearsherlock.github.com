不要變成使用者研究機器人。兩招教你可以有更好的研究產出。
Don't Be a User Research Robot. 2 Tips for Better Research 
Deliverables  


你知道要怎麼進行這類的使用者研究資料嗎？
報告內容：  
**邀請團隊成員，9個中會有7個在請求協助或表現出他們不知該如何是好之前在15秒內完成任務。  
送出一個簡訊：需要9個成員裡面有八個成功在5秒內完成。  
功能性：66.66％的人會覺得產品沒有達到基本期待。  
可用性：9成以上都覺得"系統實在不需要太過於複雜"，且都十分同意。
**

大多是的使用者研究報告和介紹通常都提供這樣的資料，但總是被忽略。  
雖然研究員應該要客觀的報告資料，但並不表示不能提供可以讓團隊前進的建議。研究員若如置身事外地產出報告並且簡報產出的時代已經過去了。  
真正重要的是該研究是否有對團隊要下決策的時候有造成影響。真正重要的是你是否可以提供建議以及團隊應該要聚焦的優先處理項目。  
在我職涯中的第一份設計研究專案是一個廣泛的使用者研究。我訪談了超過15個跨產業以及專業技能的使用者。我和產品經理、工程師和設計師開會。那是一個很珍貴的會議。我後來知道產品會發行到客戶端時並沒有與我學習到的洞察相結合，因為這個團隊沒有時間來過一次我的調查結果，並且把它放到產品的精神中。那真是一場災難。

你會怎麼做呢？  
秘訣一：給予建議    
你覺得你的團隊已經準備好要審閱50頁以上的簡報，並且花時間看幾小時的影音檔？

那些我熱愛一起工作的研究員都會處理所有的資料，並且協助這些掌握的到精神如何可以套用到產品規格或是設計線稿中。當研究員並不是都擅長於產品的know how時，可以和產品經理、工程師或是設計師一起溝通如何來完成規格或是功能或是基於已經發覺到的東西來設計的更完善。
  

我們找出並且告訴他們應該要聚焦的更大問題。我們是資料和訪談的翻譯者，可以讓一些洞察可以被執行。  
而不是：  
**邀請團隊成員，9個中會有7個在請求協助或表現出他們不知該如何是好之前沒辦法在15秒內完成任務。**

試著：  
在大多是我訪談的使用者都很難邀請團隊成員。雖然這是一個主要讓使用者進入app的方式，我建議我們重新訪查該設計以得到更多明顯的回應或是互動。使用者在請求協助之前，嘗試在他們的帳戶以及設定的區域中點擊，我們也可以在這樣的方式觀察進入點。

秘訣2 ： 給予建議並且是個人化的，就像朋友一樣。

我們的團隊在我們複製貼上一堆從使用者訪談聽到的和追蹤的資料中，並不能獲得什麼。最好的方法就是啟動一個對話。

試想一下，你會嘗試提供建議一些事情或是給建議給朋友。注意你的聲調和聲音。

而不是：

**功能性：66.66％的人會覺得產品沒有達到基本期待。
可用性：9成以上都覺得"系統實在不需要太過於複雜"。且都有很高的認同感。**

試著：
我談過的2/3使用者會覺得，現在的版本仍然沒有達到傳訊app的基本水準的預期。大多數的他們也都覺得app從啟動到傳送訊息的流程實在太複雜了。對於產品單位，我建議我們可以看一下在產品規格中有什麼是使用者覺得我們測試的情境太過基本，以致於沒有辦法滿足需求的案例優先處理。對於設計團隊，我會建議我們看一下對於一個傳送簡訊的app的工作流是否真的過於複雜。


差別是在於我們可以提供我們想要提供的所有資料來呈現數字和風險評估，但是傳達彼此的溝通更是重要。我們可以這麼做：報告結果，並且當個好的資料說書人。

此外，基於友情以及關懷你的同事，你也可以在研究過程中把他們找進來。這會讓你傳達的洞察在他們進行工作的時候會更有意義。假如你對你的同事要嘗試進行的事情有興趣，你可以幫助他們質疑自己的假設，這會讓他們做的更好。假如你有興趣學習更多人群研究，[請參考Tomer Sharon的書](http://www.amazon.com/Its-Our-Research-Stakeholder-Buy/dp/0123851300)。

Also, by being personal and caring about your coworkers, you can include them in the research process. This makes the insights you bring back more meaningful to the work they are doing. If you take interest what your coworkers are trying to do, you can help them question their own assumptions and help them do great work.

For the product team, I recommend we take a look at what we have in the product spec first prior to further user testing as people felt that what we tested was too basic to meet their needs right now. 

  
  
Do you know what to do with this sort of user research data?  

Inviting Team Members: 7 out of 9 users failed the task with a median attempt time of 15 seconds before asking for help or expressing they did not know how.  

Sending a Message: 8 out of 9 users succeeded the task with a median completion time of 5 seconds.
Functionality: 66.66% of users felt that the product did not meet basic expectations.
Usability: Out of 9 user tests conducted, the SUS Scale question, "I found the system unnecessarily complex," received a median score of 4.25 (Agree).
Most user research reports and presentations usually do provide this data, but leave it at that.  


While researchers should report data objectively, that doesn't mean they can't provide recommendations that enable a team to move forward. It's dated for researchers to remain on the sideline delivering reports and making presentations as their deliverable.  



What really matters is if research has impact for a decision that a team has to make. What really matters is if you can provide recommendations and prioritized items that the team should focus on.




One of my first design research projects in my career was a comprehensive user study on onboarding. I interviewed over 15 users across various industry verticals and expertise levels. I setup a meeting between product managers, engineers, and designers. It was a very expensive meeting. I learned later that the product that was being released to customers barely incorporated any of the insights I had learned because the team had no time to go through my findings and apply it to the product development sprints. What a disaster.





What should you do instead?  

Tip #1: Give recommendations  

Do you think your team is really going to review a 50+ page slide deck and hours worth of compiled video and audio recordings?   


The researchers I've loved working with take all the data and help show how the learnings can be applied to either a product spec or a design comp. While researchers may not always have the same level of technical know-how of a product, it's important that we, as researchers, can communicate how a product manager, engineer, or a designer can make their spec, functionality, or design better based on what we found out.  




We find out and tell them the biggest problem they should focus on. We are translators of data and interviews into actionable insights.



Instead of:

Inviting Team Members: 7 out of 9 users failed the task with a median attempt time of 15 seconds before asking for help or expressing they did not know how.

Try:

Most of the users I talked to (all except 2) had difficulty inviting a team member with the current design. Since this is a major way of getting users into the app, I recommend that we re-visit the design to include a more obvious call to action or interaction. Users tried to click around their accounts and settings area before asking for help so we could also look at points of entrance for this feature.

Tip #2: Give recommendations. And be personal, like a friend.

Our teammates don't gain much when we copy and paste what we just heard from our user interviews or log data. The best way for us to get through to them is by starting a conversation.

Imagine that you were trying to suggest something or give a recommendation to a friend. Check your tone and voice.




Instead of:

Functionality: 66.66% of users felt that the product did not meet basic expectations.

Usability: Out of 9 user tests conducted, the SUS Scale question, "I found the system unnecessarily complex," received a median score of 4.25 (Agree).

Try:

2/3rds of the users I talked to felt that the current iteration still doesn't do what they expect on a basic level for a messaging app. Most of them also felt that the flow from app start to sending a message was really complex. For the product team, I recommend we take a look at what we have in the product spec first prior to further user testing as people felt that what we tested was too basic to meet their needs right now. For the design team, I recommend we take look at the task flows as people felt that the app was really complex for a simple messaging app.

The difference is that we can provide all the data we want in the world to show the numbers and the due diligence we went through, but the way we communicate it to our peers really matters. We can do both: report the results AND be good storytellers of data.

Also, by being personal and caring about your coworkers, you can include them in the research process. This makes the insights you bring back more meaningful to the work they are doing. If you take interest what your coworkers are trying to do, you can help them question their own assumptions and help them do great work.
